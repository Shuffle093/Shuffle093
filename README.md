- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shuffle093
- 👀 I’m interested in writing, game design, worldbuilding and anything that involves storytelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning far too much for my own good. Web Development (Frontend for now), Game Design (very slow process) and lots of unrelated skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to learn the ropes for now. Been teaching myself here and there when I have time. 
- 📫 How to reach me tpfreelance.com or by email at tpfreelance@outlook.com
